Welcome to WeatherWear, a program to help you decide what to wear on a given day! This program uses tensorflow to learn what clothing combinations should be worn on which temperature and weather conditions and can be trained to your personal reference. 

More features coming soon!

Edit 07/07/20: The ML part is finished, code is cleaned up and the old stuff can be found in folders that indicate the old files.
